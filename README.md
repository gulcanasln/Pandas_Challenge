# Pandas Challenge

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics in a DataFrame.
Include the following:
Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


### School Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school.
Include the following:
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

### Maths Scores by Year

Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Year

Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.
